        <p>This example requires a bit of time to understand because of the subtle behavior. Essentially what is being
            illustrated is the inconsistency of the Dynamic HTML object model. The method HTMLIterator attempts to make up
            for this problem and generates the same object model regardless of browser. The exception being is that if your
            browser is acting like Microsoft Internet Explorer, but does not behave like Microsoft Internet Explorer! </p>
        <p>Everything between the two bars will be dynamically injected into the second text area.Make
            sure that before clicking the button that you modify the contents of the text box.</p>
        <input type="button" value="Click me to extract and inject" onclick="OnClickMe()" />
        <hr />
        <div id="toBeIteratedElement">
            <textarea id="toBeIterateTextArea" cols="60" rows="10">
                Please fill me with something
            </textarea><br />
            <input type="text" id="toBeIteratedTextBox"  size="60" value="Change me" />
        </div>
        <hr />
        <p>If in the generated text area you do not see the new text typed into the textarea and textbox then most likely you have set your
            user-agent to be Microsoft Internet Explorer. EXCEPT, your browser is not feature to feature compatible with
            Microsoft Internet Explorer. So QUITE IT and identify who you are!
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason why there is a difference relates to the behavior of the innerHTML property. On Microsoft Internet Explorer
            the property innerHTML reflects the current object model. For all other browsers it is something else entirely inconsistent as we shall see.
        </p>
        <textarea id="injectedTextArea" cols="60" rows="10">
            Don't touch, it will be filled with the HTML from above!
        </textarea>
        <p>Clicking the Inject HTML button will causes the HTML text in the second text area to be injected into the div HTML element. This
            results in the HTML being created dynamically, even though the original document did not contain the HTML.</p>
        <input type="button" value="Inject HTML" onclick="OnInjectContent()" />
        <hr />
        <div id="injectDiv"></div>
        <hr />
        <p>The final twist is to take extract the dynamically generated HTML object model. To make this demo work, please
            modify the contents of the generated textarea and textbox. First click on the Click me to extract dynamic and inject button, and then
            the Click me to extract dynamic and inject using .innerHTML.</p>
        <input type="button" value="Click me to extract dynamic and inject" onclick="OnClickMe2()" /><br/>
        <input type="button" value="Click me to extract dynamic and inject using .innerHTML" onclick="OnClickMe2InnerHTML()" /><br/>
        <textarea id="injectedTextArea2" cols="60" rows="10">
            Don't touch, it will be filled with the HTML from above!
        </textarea>
        <p>If you are using a browser other than Microsoft Internet Explorer, then clicking the two buttons will generate
            two different results. This is completely inconsistent. In the implementation of the innerHTML property of most browsers
            other than Microsoft Internet Explorer the innerHTML property represents the content of the document as the document was loaded.
            I don't agree with this, but if this is how they want to define it, fair enough. Where things get inconsistent is that when the
            document was loaded the dynamic HTML did not exist. Therefore accessing .innerHTML should have generated an empty string. What
            in fact happens is that innerHTML returns what was inject as an object model for the first time. That is inconsistent!
